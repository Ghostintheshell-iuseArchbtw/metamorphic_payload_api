### Flexible Deployment
Support for Docker containers, standalone deployment, development mode, and production-grade infrastructure with nginx and Redis.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Staged Payload with Evasion
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key" \
  -d '{
    "type": "staged",
    "evasion_techniques": ["environment_checks", "process_checks"],
    "complexity_level": 8
  }'
